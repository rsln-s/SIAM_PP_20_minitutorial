### Combinatorial Optimization on Quantum Computers

This repository contains slides and Jupyter Notebooks for the minitutorial "Combinatorial Optimization on Quantum Computers" at SIAM Conference on Parallel Processing for Scientific Computing (PP20)

#### Prerequisites 

The recommended platform for running these notebooks is IBM IQX. Alternatively, you can run the notebooks on your local machine, but that would require you setting up the environment with Python 3 and installing Qiskit (additional instructions are available in the notebook). To create an account, go to https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/ and login with an IBM ID. If you do not have an IBM ID, please create a new one.

After logging in, go to Qiskit Notebooks:
